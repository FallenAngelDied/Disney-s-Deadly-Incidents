At the time of creating this dataset it was close to Halloween.

Basic Description:

This dataset is complied of the deaths that took place at Disneyland and Disney World since the opening of both theme parks in California and in Florida.

Basic findings:

Of the 92 deaths at Disney Parks, 66 are from Disneyland (FL) and 26 at Disney World. It would seem that Florida has the most deadly incidents than California, however it seems people in California's incident's have to do more with suicide than anything else with Mickey & Friends parking the go-to place for their suicide, so to speak. Florida seems to have more accidents and known/unknown health issues.
